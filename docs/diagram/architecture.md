# MY_Practice – High-level Architecture

## 1. Overview

**MY_Practice** is an MVP e-commerce system designed as a small, realistic microservices playground:

- **Frontend:** React SPA
- **API Gateway:** YARP (ASP.NET Core reverse proxy)
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core microservices (.NET 8)
- **Data:** SQL Server (containerized); each service has its own database/schema
- **Auth:** JWT tokens issued by the Auth service
- **Runtime (dev):** `dotnet run` for services, `docker compose` for infrastructure

### Goals

- Practice modern **microservice** patterns with .NET 8 + React
- Explore **API gateway** routing with YARP
- Use **EF Core** with per-service databases
- Implement **end-to-end flows**: registration, login, browsing catalog, wallet, and order creation
